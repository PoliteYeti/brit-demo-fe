# Brit-Demo-FE

This repo contains the source for the frontend app included in the demo for Brit.

This is my first time seriously attempting to build something in svelte, be kind.

Due to time limitations, the app works and is correct according to the brief but has only been manually tested on the happy path.

Known issues:
- The toggle button is not dynamic and should change label depending on mode.
- The app is not referencing its relative server and has a full URI.
- All actions make requests to the server but this is not made visible to the user.
